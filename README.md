## My mistake

Well, it turns out I actually bought two domains for you.  SimWard.net and SimchaWard.com, because i thought you'd like them and i enjoy doing stuff that makes my friends happy.  Turns out, you're actually just an ungrateful little shit who claims to "already have a website" but yet still can't figure out how to make it actually work.

What a butthole.  You suck.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gta-productions/simchaward.com/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gta-productions/simchaward.com/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
